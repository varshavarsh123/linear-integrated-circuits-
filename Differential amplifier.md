perform DC Analysis, Transient Analysis, Frequency Response and find out required parameters.

# Overview 
A differential amplifier **amplifies the difference between two input signals** while ignoring any signals that are common to both inputs. It's like focusing on what makes two signals different and ignoring what makes them the same.
It's useful in reducing noise and is commonly used in devices like op-amps and communication systems.
